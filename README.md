# Optimizing Store Network Density via Geospatial Clustering and Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the spatial distribution of existing stores and their sales performance to optimize the store network.  It employs geospatial clustering techniques to identify areas with high store density and potential for consolidation, as well as areas with low density where new stores could be profitably established. The analysis leverages sales data to inform decisions, aiming to maximize overall profitability by optimizing store placement.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for clustering algorithms)
* Geopandas (for geospatial analysis)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You will need to provide your own store location data (e.g., CSV file with latitude, longitude, and sales data) in the format specified within the `main.py` script.  The exact file path and format may be defined as parameters or hardcoded within the script.  Please refer to the script's comments for details.


## Example Output

The script will produce the following output:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summaries of the geospatial clustering results, including the number of clusters identified, cluster centroids, and relevant sales statistics for each cluster.  This will also include analysis suggesting potential locations for new stores or areas for consolidation.

* **Plot Files:**  Several plot files will be generated visualizing the store locations, clusters, and sales trends. Examples include maps showing store locations and their respective clusters, and plots showing sales performance over time or across different clusters.  These files (e.g., `store_locations.png`, `sales_by_cluster.png`, `cluster_map.png`) will be saved in the project's directory.
